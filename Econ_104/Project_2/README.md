This is Project 2 for Econ 104, Data Science for Economists and in this project, we are woring with time series data and forecasting. We study the climate change in Delhi, India. We use ADF tests, summary statistics, ACF graphs, PACF graphs, and AIC/BIC tests in order to determine our model to predict climate change in india. This project is an introduction into time series and projecting results in the future as well as determining stationary trends in order to develop an ARDL model (we also tested AR models and looked into MA and VAR models to inspect if they would be a better fit).

The dataset for the file can be found on Kaggle, uploaded by "SUMANTHVRAO" in 2019 with data being collected from 2013 to 2017.
