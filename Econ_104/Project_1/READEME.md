This is Project 1 from Econ 104, Data Science for Economists, where this project takes in world happiness data from Kaggle and we create a report on what factors contribute the most to the happiness of a country. We used linear regression models, hypothesis and t-testing, boruta algorithm, VIF model, and Mallows CP to generate our project and results. This specific project is specifically detecting hetereoskedascity using RESET and white tests and accounting for them if hetereoskedascity is present. 

The data file comes from Kaggle, uploaded by "Sustainable Development Solutions Network" in 2019 in the 2019.csv file.
