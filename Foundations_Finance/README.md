In this project, Foundations_Finance, I examine the financial flow for Foundations Choregraphy at UCLA for 2021-2022. As their finance chair for the 2021-2022 year as well as the 2022-2023 year, it is my duty to ensure funds, payments, and financial health for the organization otherwise there would be no events. Using venmo data from the 2021-2022 year, I examine areas of strength and weakness as to which areas of funding contribute the most and which contribute the least. I also give ideas on how to make our weaker areas of funding stronger. I also created a simple linear agression between the number of competitive dance teams and the amount of funding estimated from it.
